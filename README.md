*This is a videoclip from a project in the repo, meant to procedually generate the terrain and environment for a given grid. I plan on converting it into a full tool for later development projects*

Im learning about cellular automata and have become quite interested in it. The fact that with as little as 3 primitive rules we are able to produce some very complex behaviours is something that impulsed me, to keep making projects related to it. 


Feel free to test and run on your machine!
